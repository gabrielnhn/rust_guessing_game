#### I'm also still trying to figure out how Rust works

But apparently after installing `rustup` one can use

```bash
$ cargo run
```

and all dependencies will be downloaded and installed, and source/config files will be checked, compiled, linked and executed! 


Yeah this is just my take on the literal first program on the official Rust Programming Language Book available [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), the difference is that I spent about 45min because I was stubborn and didn't want to read the tutorial and was willing to bruteforce my way into making this program work
